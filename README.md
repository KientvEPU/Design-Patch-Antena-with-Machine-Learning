# Design-Patch-Antena-with-Machine-Learning
Using AI algorithms to aid antenna design

This report contains the source code artifact for the IEEE Access

We provide 6 different source code files to perform simulations for 6 algorithms. The source code files are written in Jupyter notebook format.

Each source file presents the complete steps of the machine learning process and evaluates the results for patch antenna design.
